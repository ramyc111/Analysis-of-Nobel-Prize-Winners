Analysis of Nobel Prize Winners
Advanced Data-Driven Analysis of Nobel Prize Winners’ Demographic and Institutional Trends
Problem
This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the Nobel Prize winners’ dataset with a focus on identifying and quantifying factors associated with Nobel success across multiple dimensions, such as country affiliation, age demographics, funding sources, and institutional connections. Unlike general demographic studies, this project will systematically explore "common pathways to Nobel success" by integrating Natural Language Processing (NLP), time-series analysis, and clustering. This includes investigating if specific awards, institutions, or grants are frequently associated with Nobel laureates, and if such associations have changed over time.
Key Research Questions:
1.	What countries have the highest Nobel laureates per capita, and how do these rates change over time?
2.	What are the age trends among Nobel laureates, and do specific categories show distinct age patterns?
3.	Which awards, funding sources, or institutions are frequently associated with future Nobel laureates, and do these associations correlate with higher chances of winning the prize?
